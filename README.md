# RUBIDIUM/EMBEDDIUM EXTRAS
Magnesium Extras add a lot of features to Magnesium or Rubidium 
(Forge Sodium) to improve the mod. 
It includes several features from other mods, 
packaged into one add-on that you'll want to install for the best experience.

## CURSEFORGE
You can download mod from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnesium-extras)

## Features
- **Borderless screen:** Minecraft's default mode makes it hard to tab out. This is off by default, but replaces the vanilla Sodium fullscreen option.
- **Better FPS Counter:** Looks nicer, and can be customized to display minimum frametimes (useful for debugging lag on tick) and average frametimes over the last 15 seconds (for accurate benchmarking)
- **Zoom key!:** A port of "Ok Zoomer" from Fabric, bound to C, allows you to view far away objects more easily.
- **True Darkness:** Has options to make night time & caves realistically dark. Can be configured or turned off.
- **Fog toggle:** An option to turn off all fog, which is missing from vanilla Sodium.
- **Extended View distance:** Let you see more chunks than the specified limited on server-side
- **Customizable Cloud Height:** Vanilla clouds are quite low, and there's no other mod to raise them on Forge. This mod defaults them to being a bit higher.
- **Entity Distance Culling:** Improve performance in modpacks drastically by not rendering far away entities. Includes a configurable Y value so you can disable rendering mobs in caves while you're on the surface. Can be configured or disabled. Incompatible with Out Of Sight, because that mod does the same thing, and doesn't support Sodium anyway.
- **ForgetMeChunk performance hack (may cause GPU memory leaks):**
- **Integration With Magnesium/Rubidium Dynamic Lights:** This mod works perfectly with MDL, and improves its performance drastically with its optimizations. If you have MDL, you'll want to install this mod.
